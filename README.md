# Lab-on-Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing
Parallelization Programming Practicum using OpenMP, MPI, OpenCL.

* [HW 1: Data Partition and Reduction in OpenMP](HW1): Use data partition technic in OpenMP, ***parallel*** and ***for*** pragma, to parallelize common algorithm problems including finding the single number in an array that only appears once, computing the square of hadamard product.

* [HW 2: Task Partition and Parallelization in OpenMP](HW2): Use task partition technic in OpenMP, ***parallel***, ***for***, ***task*** and ***single*** pragma to parallelize common algorithm problems including finding k-th smallest number in an array, finding number of inversion pairs in an array, reconstructing binary tree.

* [HW 3: Message Passing Interface for Parallel Programming](HW3): Use message passing model MPI to parallelize the process of prime number filtering.

* [Final Project: ](FinalProject): 
  - Implemented Transposed Convolution algorithm using OpenCL, measured performance with different work-item configuration.
  - Utilized MPI to implement K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, improved node distance computation by GPU acceleration using OpenCL.
